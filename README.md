## Content Insights
I learned how to build professional looking websites using WordPress with no coding skills required, the steps to take to choose a web hosting platform, and learned how to apply for a free domain name and set up a hosting plan.

The video then showed in detail the process of website customization in the WordPress dashboard, including using the built-in customization tools and the recommended Yoast SEO plugin for search engine optimization. I learned about theme selection and basic customization steps, while emphasizing that it's better to spend too much time on the details than to publish the site first and then optimize it.

At the same time, I understood how to create a WordPress website on a personal computer (PC or Mac) using Local, a free tool that requires no web hosting fees. The "Live Link" feature enables collaboration by sharing a locally hosted site for feedback.

I learned the definition of localhost and its application in web server settings. localhost is the default name of the local computer address, usually denoted as the IP address 127.0.0.1, which is used to point a web server or software to the local machine when setting it up. I learned the three main advantages of localhost, including testing a program or Web application during development, improving security by blocking access to specific Web sites, and evaluating network performance by performing a ping test against localhost. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I learned how to build professional websites using WordPress, which will have a profound impact on my future career and in my work. First and foremost, I can become an all-around web developer and build a strong online presence for clients and businesses. This skill is not only marketable in the freelance market, but is also very popular amongst digital teams within companies.

After learning the process of website customization in the WordPress dashboard via video, I am now able to personalize the site to my clients' needs and make it look professional and on-brand. This not only improves the user experience, but also helps to improve the website's ranking in search engines.

The skill of creating WordPress websites on my personal computer using the Local tool has given me more flexibility to test and make changes during the development phase. I am no longer constrained by the online environment and can more easily tweak and improve the site to ensure that the final product is of high quality and meets customer expectations.

Additionally, I learned about the applications and benefits of localhost, which provided me with greater insight into web security. I was able to increase the security of my development environment by blocking access to localhost, as well as evaluating the performance of my network by running ping tests against it.

Overall, the insights I gained through these learnings have opened up new possibilities for my future career path. Whether as an independent developer, digital marketing professional, or in-house technical support, I am able to apply these skills and knowledge to create an impactful online presence for clients and organizations. My future career will be even more diverse and challenging, and I look forward to continuing to develop and refine these skills.
